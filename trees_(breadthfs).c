Trees 2: breadth first search

the opposite of a depth first search.
	as opposite, uses a Queueueueue
	first in first out vs last in first out

You visit 1 level of the tree at a time, even if its sparsely populated

	still go left to right, by convention

(he doesnt present a way to do this via recursion. Makes sense, just mentioning since recursion for last few things)



time complexity

	breadth-first is O(n)
		UNLESS you use a javascript array (which he does for his example), then its O(n**2)
			(honestly dont really understand why. See:https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/breadth-first-search/ )
