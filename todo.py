small exercises from this lesson that might be beneficial to do at some point:


class not_yet_done
	
	Heap code which can be given a function/comparison, like qsort, and be a min or max heap
	
	quicksort function which can be given a function/comparison, like qsort

	implementing tree stuff
		BST
		DFS
		BFS
	
	recursion-less sqrt(n) exercise

	? implement a Trie

	? recursion-less heap??
		honestly, Im not that motivated to do the non-recursion variants now that I understand recursion better
	
	buo of trie 'caching' interview Q

class not_not_yet_done
	
	recursion-less quicksort
