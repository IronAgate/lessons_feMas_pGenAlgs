opposite of a queue

	or inverse of a queue

	// essentially, just the head/tail are reversed in operation


		in queue, you add to the end of the list and take from the front
		in stack, you add to the 'end' of the list and take from that 'end'

'stack trace' from errors is the 'stack' of functions called up until that point


essentially, there is no tail, since we are always taking from the 'top' of the 'stack'


when illustrating stacks, best practice to draw it backwards from the queue to make it clearer


//he goes through implementing a stack, but I've decided not to implement it here since its so similar to the queue and theres a lot more overhead for me in C

	may say 'prev' instead of next for internal varnames of nodes, just to help illustrate

	typically named 'pop' and 'push' instead of en/de-queue
