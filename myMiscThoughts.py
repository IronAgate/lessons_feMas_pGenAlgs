what if you have a sequence of separate arrays linked together like a linked list?
	so you can walk btwn different arrays & add to the array without rewriting, and you can still index somewhat when within the proper array node


	I guess thats just still a linked list, where the value is an array instead of an int or something?

		but extra functions to index through the arrays as one would be relevant
